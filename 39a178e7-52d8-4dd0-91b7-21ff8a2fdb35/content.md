The Make School Summer Academy is an 8 week program targeting 13-25 year old students who spend their summer with us learning to design, code, and ship their own app or game. Last summer, students came from over 30 countries with 21% of the student body belonging to a minority group underrepresented in tech. Alums who attended while in high school have gone on to study computer science at Stanford, MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley, and other top schools. Alums who attended while in college have gone on to land internships at Apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla, and other top companies. Locations have included San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Los Angeles, New York City, Singapore, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.
