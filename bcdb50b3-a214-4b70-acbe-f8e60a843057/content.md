For some MakeSchool alumni, the end of the fall
season of collegiate hackathons means the chance to
finally catch a breath of air. Three of the top college
hackathons were organized by MakeSchool alums.

HackPrinceton, organized by Carole Touma, had
people stepping out of their comfort zones as they worked
on software and hardware projects. Katie Siegel’s HackMIT
saw over one thousand students working on cutting­edge
technology. At HackDuke, Scotty Shaw helped a
“Hackathon for Social Good” run smoothly.

MakeSchool sponsored and mentored at each of
the hackathons. It was tons of fun helping students of all
levels working on cool and varied hacks! We also loved
getting to see all the fantastic ideas being brought to life.

There were some amazing hacks to improve lives
around the globe at HackDuke, where MakeSchool hosted
workshops for students of all levels. Beginners and experts
alike honed iOS and game development skills.

The students at HackMIT loved the two different
Build­Flappy­Bird workshops that we hosted, filling the
room up both times as we coded in Objective­C and Swift,
respectively. We were paired to mentor over ten different
teams building brilliant iOS apps, along with providing
coding help to hackers throughout the hackathon.

Hackers at HackPrinceton were given a workshop
on “How to Break Into Tech”
advice on networking and getting a job in the tech industry.
Princeton’s hackathon had a packed house, filled to the
brim with students working on challenging and innovative
projects.

Congratulations to Carole Touma, Scotty Shaw
and Katie Siegel for all your hard work! We can’t wait until
next year.
