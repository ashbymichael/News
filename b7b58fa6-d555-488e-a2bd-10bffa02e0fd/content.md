Make School is building the Product University for aspiring software engineers and founders. Students spend two years learning computer science foundations, software engineering, and product development through a blend of individually paced, project-based learning and industry experience. Unlike traditional university, students have zero upfront cost for the program; they pay tuition through earnings.

We're looking for someone to build corporate partnerships for our program and get our students hired. It's critical for us to ensure strong outcomes for our students and enable them to work at their dream companies. You'll be responsible for building relationships with the engineering and recruiting departments of the coolest tech startups to get them excited about our program, convince them to interview our students, and sell them on a formal partnership to fund our students' education. You'll also be using these relationships to recruit mentors and guest lecturers and collect feedback on how we can improve our teaching and curriculum.

- Good understanding of the development landscape

<b>About Make School</b><br>Make School is building a university replacement for Computer Science.
The program spans two years, divided by a six month internship at a tech startup. Students learn the CS theory covered by traditional universities paired with the practical experience of building and shipping products plus soft skills such as ethics, storytelling, and interpersonal communication.<br><br>
Students network with successful founders and developers throughout the program, and are placed at a tech startup upon graduating. The program has no up front cost, students pay tuition through internship and post-grad job earnings. <br><br>
Our pilot class kicked off last September with eleven students, two chose Make School over MIT. They shipped apps like Stitch News and Refuge Restrooms (featured in Buzzfeed) and received offers from Snapchat, Pandora, Edmodo, Dailymotion, Dr. Chrono and more. <br><br>
We also run a two month Summer Academy teaching iOS development and our online curriculum powers courses at MIT and Carnegie Mellon.
